# UWâ€“Madison Math/CS 514: Code examples
Math/CS 514 is a course taught at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. The goal
of the course is to provide graduate students and advanced undergraduate
students with an introduction to numerical analysis, or numerical approaches to
calculus.

Topics to be covered include root-finding, interpolation, polynomial
approximation, numerical differentiation and integration, and the numerical
solution of ordinary differential equations. The course will cover mathematical
theory, and also the issues concerning the implementation of the algorithms on
modern computer hardware.

The codes are primarily written in Python and make use of several
well-established libraries

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org) for numerical linear algebra
- [SciPy](https://scipy.org) for scientific routines and algorithms
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) for graphing and visualization

In addition, a number of programs output data to text in a format that can be
read by the freeware plotting program [Gnuplot](http://gnuplot.info).

Enrolled students can access the [course Canvas
website](https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/330368) for more information.
