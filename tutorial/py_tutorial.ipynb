    "### **A quick note about notebooks**\n",
    "Notebooks are a useful way to organize and annotate code especially for demos, support $\\LaTeX$ for writing mathematical expressions, and allow code to be executed in smaller blocks (cells) that can help to simplify a large program. However, you'll see code examples throughout the course primarily as ```.py``` scripts executed via terminal, which is typically our preferred environment for easily and efficiently running programs. However, for this demo and if you choose to use notebooks later on, there are a couple of important points to keep in mind:\n",
    "- The block structure allows code to be run out of order, so be careful that you've executed your cells in order from top to bottom.\n",
    "- Variables, objects, and functions you define persist throughout your notebook while your session is active, even if you delete the cell(s) that defined them. If you want to delete or rename a variable, make sure you update its occurrences throughout the notebook. You can restart your runtime and run all cells to check for any undefined variables."
